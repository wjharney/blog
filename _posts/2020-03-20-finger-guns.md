In the era of COVID-19, social distancing, and self-isolation, you are probably looking for some way to define your
normal. I'm not a health expert or lifestyle influencer or anything fancy like that, but I do have one humble
suggestion: don't replace handshakes with elbow bumps or footshakes. Those are weird. Instead, I recommend that you do
finger guns. Here's why:

- Already established as a socially acceptable form of greeting. Won't confuse people out of the loop.
- Already established as a _cool_ form of greeting. :point_right:&nbsp;:sunglasses:&nbsp;:point_right:
- Zero contact, so a lower chance of transmitting disease. It can also be done in passing or virtually.
- Emoji support. Left and right makes for a great call and response!
:point_right:&nbsp;:sunglasses:&nbsp;:point_right:

I think that finger guns have a great potential to revolutionize social interactions, and I hope you'll join me in using
them as the default form of greeting.
