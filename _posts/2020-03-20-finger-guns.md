In the era of COVID-19, social distancing, and self-isolation, you are probably looking for some way to define your
normal. I'm not a health expert or lifestyle influencer or anything fancy like that, but I do have one humble
suggestion: don't replace handshakes with elbow bumps or foot shakes. Those are weird. Instead, I recommend that you do
finger guns. It's established, versatile, and makes you seem way cooler to your friends and colleagues. See the chart
below for irrefutable proof that this is what you should be doing.
